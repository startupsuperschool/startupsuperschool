# Risotto

**Risotto** is an Italian dish made with a starchy short grain rice like Arborio or Carnaroli that is cooked slowly in broth until it reaches a creamy consistency. 

To prepare risotto, the rice is typically cooked in a broth, adding small amounts at a time and stirring constantly to release the starches in the rice, resulting in a creamy texture.

Common additions to risotto include ingredients such as meat, seafood, vegetables, and cheese. Popular variations include mushroom risotto, shrimp risotto, and asparagus risotto.

Risotto is known for its rich, creamy texture and versatility in flavor combinations. It is considered a comfort food in many parts of Italy and is often served as a main course or side dish.
